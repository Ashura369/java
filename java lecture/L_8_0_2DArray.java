    A 2D array (two-dimensional array) is an array of arrays. It’s like a table with rows and columns, where each element is accessed by two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

    - A 2D array is a way to store data in a grid or matrix form.
    - Each position in a 2D array is identified by two indices: [row][column].
    - It’s commonly used for representing things like matrices, game boards (chess, tic-tac-toe), or tables of data.

    Syntax -- 
        type[][] arrayName = new type[rows][columns];
        e.g. -- int[][] numbers = new int[3][5];
